## Few points to take note of

1. Open two terminals, one for each parent directory (client and server)
2. In both `client` and `parent` directories ensure all the packages were installed using `npm i`
3. Then also ensure to copy the `.env.example` and paste in `.env` and update the ENV variables of your choice
4. `npm run dev` for both the repositories, start with `server` first and then `client`
